## 🚩 Problem Statement

In most businesses, **not all customers are equally valuable**.

However, many companies:
- Treat all customers the same  
- Spend marketing budgets blindly  
- React *after* customers churn instead of predicting behavior early  

❌ **Result:**  
- Wasted marketing spend  
- Poor customer retention  
- No long-term revenue strategy  

👉 The real challenge is:

> **“How can we predict how valuable a customer will be in the future using historical data?”**

## 💡 Solution Overview

This project builds a **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction System** that:

✅ Analyzes customer behavior  
✅ Engineers meaningful features  
✅ Trains an ML model to predict CLV  
✅ Follows a clean, production-style code structure  

The system estimates **how much revenue a customer is likely to generate over time**, allowing businesses to:

- Focus on **high-value customers**
- Optimize **marketing & retention strategies**
- Improve **long-term profitability**

## 🧠 What is Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)?

**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** is the **total profit a business expects from a customer throughout their relationship**.

In simple words:
> **CLV tells us which customers are worth keeping and investing in.**
